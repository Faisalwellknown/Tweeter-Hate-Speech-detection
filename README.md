# Twitter Hate Speech Detection using BERT

This project implements a machine learning model using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to detect hate speech in tweets. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and provides a classification of tweets into hate, offensive, or neutral categories.

## üîç Project Objective

The goal is to:
- Analyze tweets for hateful or offensive content
- Build a robust NLP pipeline using the power of BERT
- Evaluate model performance on real-world social media data

## üß† Technologies Used

- Python üêç
- Jupyter Notebook üìí
- TensorFlow & Keras
- HuggingFace Transformers
- Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- BERT Pretrained Model

## üìä Dataset

We use the [Hate Speech and Offensive Language Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aymanarafa/twitter-hate-speech) which includes:
- **Tweet text**
- **Labels** for: hate speech, offensive language, and neither

The file `labeled_data.csv` contains all training data.

## üß† Model Architecture

- Tokenizer: BERT base uncased
- Preprocessing: lowercasing, padding, truncation
- Fine-tuned using TensorFlow/Keras
- Output Layer: Softmax (3 classes)

## üöÄ How to Run

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The trained model file `variables.data-00000-of-00001` was removed from the repo (GitHub size limit). Please download it manually (see below).

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Faisalwellknown/Tweeter-Hate-Speech-detection.git
cd Tweeter-Hate-Speech-detection
2. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Download the Model Weights
Download saved_model weights from Google Drive

Place the file inside:

saved_model/variables/variables.data-00000-of-00001
4. Run the Notebook
Use Jupyter or Colab:


jupyter notebook Twitter_Hate_Speech_Detection_using_BERT.ipynb
